Skills represent a character’s areas of knowledge, or fields of expertise. 
There are two levels a character can have in a skill: Proficient and Expertise.

When making skill checks using a skill in which the character is proficient, the player can add the character’s Proficiency modifier to the checks total.

When making skill checks using a skill in which the character has Expertise, the player can add double the character’s Proficiency modifier to the checks total.


## Selecting Skills
When making your character you may choose to word your skills however you like. When the Game Master asks you to make a skill check you will negotiate with them which of your skills are relevant to the check. Only one skill bonus can be added to each check.

Try to make your skill names as descriptive as possible. “Tracking monsters” is good but “Tracking monsters in the Neverwinter Woods” is better.

Avoid very vague or far reaching skill names such as “Moving quickly” or “Magic”. Skills related to using weapons and equipment should also be avoided, since these are covered by other rules.

If you are stuck for a skill name then consider one of the skills below.

- Local history of the [name] area
- Knowledge of monster behaviour and habitats
- Navigation in the [name] region
- Mercantile connections in [city name]
