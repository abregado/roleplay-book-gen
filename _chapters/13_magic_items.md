Attunement
Some magical items require attunement to a specific operator in addition to being equipped before their capabilities become usable.

Any character can spend 1 uninterrupted hour with a magic item to attune to it. Doing so reveals its workings and effects to the player. Any effects which are triggered by attunement are also applied.

An item cannot be attuned to multiple characters at the same time. After an attunement is complete, the item loses all other attunements it had.

An item becomes unattuned if it spends at least 1 hour more than 100 metres away from its attuned character.

Charges and Recharging
Some magical items can only be used several times before needing to recharge. Each item that has charges will also include a description of how it is recharged.

The most common situation is that an item will recharge some or all of its charges when its owner takes a long rest.
