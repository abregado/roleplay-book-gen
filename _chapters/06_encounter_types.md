# Grid Combat Encounters
Many battles fought during the game will be played on a grid with tokens representing both the player characters and their opponents. This is not the only way to determine combat, but it is the most common.

Grid based combat gives the players and GM a good overview of the action, allowing them to more easily declare actions that make sense for everyone. One downside of this style of combat is that it can take much longer than other methods to complete.
## Beginning Combat
Setting up combat takes place in four steps.

{: .step_list}
1. the GM determines if either side has been ambushed.
2. the GM positions all creature tokens onto the map, and explains any important interactable objects or dangerous areas.
3. the GM determines if any players or creatures in the combat will start with the Surprised condition. This can happen in a number of ways.
4players roll an Initiative test to determine their play order. 

### Initiative tests
Each player rolls a D20 and adds their Initiative modifier, which is equal to their Dexterity modifier plus any additional bonuses they have from features, and record this number.

Surprised creatures have an Initiative score of zero.

## Which group goes first?
If the players have been ambushed, then the opposing group will go first, otherwise the players group will go first.

## Enemy group order
Enemies act in any order that the GM seems fit. The order can change between rounds. Units near one another should have their rounds consecutively. Once all enemies has had a turn, the players may start their round.

## Player group order
Players will act in order from the highest initiative rolled to the lowest initiative rolled. The order does not change once combat has begun. Once player has taken their turn, the enemies start their round.

## Combat Round structure
Each round is 6 seconds. During each round, each creature will complete one turn.

{: .itemlist_prefix}
A turn consists of three parts:

{: .itemlist}
- Start Turn
- Turn Actions and Movement
-  End Turn

### Start Turn
Many abilities and features will have special effects that must be determined at the start of a creature's turn. Be sure to sort these out before continuing.

### Turn Actions and Movement
During a creature's turn, its controlling player decides what it will do. During its turn, a creature makes one Full Action (called from here on simply Action), one Bonus Action, a shorter type of action and a Movement.

### End Turn
Once a creature has completed any actions it intends to do, its controlling player declares that its turn is over. Many effects trigger at the end of a creature’s turn, so be sure to let all players know when this happens.

## Movement
Characters generally move 12m per round. This can be modified by many factors but is generally listed on their character sheet as Base Speed or Walking Speed.

### Difficult Terrain
Creatures can only move at full speed over unbroken, clear and well lit terrain. If there is any consistent hindrance to progress, such as loose flooring, darkness or thick foliage, creatures must spend an extra metre of movement for every metre they move.

### Climbing, Swimming and Crawling
While climbing, swimming or crawling, a creature must spend one additional metre of movement for every metre moved. If this is also over difficult terrain, then 3 metres must be spent for every one metre moved.

### Jumping
A character can jump across a gap equal to 4 metres plus their Strength modifier. This distance is halved unless they are able to complete a 4 metre run up before they jump.

Generally, unless the landing area is completely clear of obstacles, a creature must pass a DC 10 Dexterity skill check or suffer the Prone condition upon landing.

At the GMs discretion, this skill check may also be considered Risky.

### Creature size
Creatures take up a different amount of space based on their Size Class. The following table shows how much space is used for each size class:

{: .roll_table}
|Size| Space                |
|----|----------------------|
|Tiny| 1m x 1m square              |
|Small| 2m x 2m square              |
|Medium| 2m x 2m square              |
|Large| 2-4 2m x 2m squares  |
|Huge|  5-9 2m x 2m squares |

### Moving around other Creatures
Creatures can move through other non-hostile creatures. If a hostile creature is two sizes larger than a moving creature, the moving creature can move through its space.
Creatures may not end their movements inside other creatures' spaces.
If a creature which was adjacent to another hostile creature moves away so that it is no longer adjacent, then it may trigger an Attack of Opportunity.

### Squeezing
Creatures can only move freely through spaces in which they fit. If a creature wants to move through a space which is smaller than its Size Class would allow, it must spend an extra 1 metre of movement for every 1 metre moved.

## Actions
Actions take up the bulk of a creature’s turn. Generally this may be attacking or defending itself, but can also include causing spells or making skill checks.
A creature or character will have several actions listed on its character sheet. The text for each one includes the requirements for it being available on a given turn.
The Actions below can be taken by any creature on their turn, regardless of if they are listed on their character sheet or stat block.

### Attack
As an Action: The creature may make one strike using any of its weapons or features.

### Grappling
As an Action: Target an adjacent creature of size equal to or smaller than yourself. Decide if the grapple will be Strength or Dexterity based. The target must pass a Saving throw with a DC equal to two plus double your Ability score modifier or gain the Grappled condition.

### Shoving
As an Action: Target an adjacent creature of size no greater than one class larger than yourself. The target must pass a Strength or Dexterity Saving throw with a DC equal to two plus double your Strength score modifier or be moved 2 metres away from you.
If the target is larger than you, they gain Advantage on the saving throw. If they are smaller, they suffer Disadvantage.

### Dodge
As an Action: Until the start of its next turn, the Dodging creature has advantage on saving throws against any attacker that it can see, and those attackers have disadvantage on all attack rolls made against the dodging creature.
If the dodging creature gains any condition which reduces its movement speed to zero, it loses the advantages of taking the Dodge action.

### Dash
As an Action: When a creature uses the Dash action, it may move an additional amount on its turn equal to its Walking speed. This additional movement can be spent at any time during the creature’s turn just like regular movement.

### Ready Action
As an Action: Declare another Action, Bonus Action or Free Action you are currently able to use and decide on a trigger. At any point until your next turn starts, you may spend your Reaction to use that Action immediately, interrupting whatever creature was currently taking its turn. You may also spend any unused movement from your turn as you take this action.
If you ready a Spell action, you must spend the required resources immediately and maintain Concentration until you trigger the action, otherwise the spell fails.

### Help
As an Action: Select a creature within 2 metres of you. If that creature makes a skill check that you are Proficient in, or makes an attack roll against a target you can see that is also adjacent to you, before your next turn starts, it gains Advantage on the roll.

### Hide
As an Action: You attempt to obscure your true position from one or more targets, all of which you must have full cover from. The attempt is considered a success without a roll, however at the moment when the target might see you, make a Dexterity skill check to see if you were successful or not.
See the Unseen Attackers section for the benefits of Hiding.

### Disengage
As an Action: All movement you make during your turn does not provoke Attacks of Opportunity.

## Bonus Actions
Bonus Actions are considered shorter actions that compliment a Full Action. There is only one bonus action which can be used by every creature.

### Offhand attack
As a Bonus Action, after using the Attack Action: Make a single strike with a second weapon that you are also holding. The weapon used must have the Light property. Do not add additional damage to the strike based on an Ability score.

## Reactions
Reactions are not spent during your turn, but instead during the turns of other creatures. Generally the text of a reaction will include a trigger which describes the situation in which it can be used.
Each creature regains the use of its Reaction at the start of its turn, unless some condition or effect prevents this.
There are two reactions which can be used by any creature.

### Use readied action
As a Reaction, when your trigger occurs: Complete the Action, Bonus action or Free Action you described during your turn, and optionally spend any movement you had left over.

### Attack of opportunity
As a Reaction, when a creature leaves adjacency: Make a single strike with a melee weapon or touch cantrip against the target.

## Free Actions
Free actions are not limited in the normal way during a turn. Unless specified, a Free action can be used as many times as a creature wants during its turn. Such as this generic one:

**Free action:** Drop an item you are holding in your hand.

**Free action:** Gain the Prone condition.

Many free actions do have limitations. Such limitations are always listed in the action description. Some generic examples:

**Free action, once per turn:** Interact with a simple object such as a door or lever at any point during your movement.

**Free action, once per turn:** Draw to a free hand a weapon you are carrying, or sheath a weapon you are holding.

## Other Action sources
A creature or character may use any action, bonus action, reaction or free action that is granted from a feature or piece of equipment they have, as long as the requirements for that action are met.

## Making an Attack
When making an Attack, whether it is with a sword, spell or bow, the same process applies.

{: .step_list}
1. Choose a target within range that the creature can detect. The target can be a creature, object or specific location.
2. GM determines the type of attack roll and if it will be Risky.
3. GM determines the Difficulty Class, any modifiers and whether the roll has Advantage or Disadvantage.
4. Make the Attack Roll.
5. Resolve the strike.

### Types of Attack Roll
{: .itemlist_prefix}
There are four types of attack roll:

{: .itemlist}
- Melee weapon attack roll
- Ranged weapon attack roll
- Melee spell attack roll 
- Ranged spell attack roll

Different effects or creature features will trigger against different kinds of attack roll so it is important to know which kind is being performed.

### Risky Attack Rolls
As with Ability checks, Attack rolls can be Risky. If a 1 is rolled on a Risky skill check, then something bad has happened.

The most common situation which results in a Risky Attack Roll is when attacking a target which is adjacent to another friendly creature that is also within range of the attack. In this case, rolling a 1 generally means you hit the friendly target instead.

### Visibility, Sight, Lighting and Cover
A creature may only attack a target that it can detect. Detection can be granted in many ways but generally it is gained via Line of Sight.

If a creature is undetected by the attacker, then it may not be selected as a target.

There are many situations where a target may be considered detected, but obscured, such as when it is standing behind cover but can still be seen.

If a creature makes an attack against a target which has not detected it, then the attack is made with Advantage.

If a creature makes an attack against a target which is obscured, then the attack is made with Disadvantage.

There are many different Features which affect how a creature can detect others, and many abilities and spells which obscure a target. The interpretation of how these interplay is generally the job of the GM.

### Ranged Attack Rolls
When making ranged spell or ranged weapon attack rolls against adjacent targets or targets with the Prone condition, the rolls are made at Disadvantage.

### Melee Attack Rolls
When making melee spell or melee weapon attack rolls against Prone targets, the rolls are made with Advantage.

# Travel Encounters
## Starting a Journey

{: .step_list}
1. Players choose a destination within 1 days travel.
2. GM decides the navigation DC and if the trip is considered Risky.
3. Each player chooses one downtime activity.
4. A Wisdom ability check is made for each character using the navigator's ability score. On a failure, the character must forgo their Downtime activity due to lateness.

## Consequences
{: .itemlist_prefix}
If the check is Risky and more than half the rolls fail, then one of several things might happen:

{: .itemlist}
- One or more characters have an unsuccessful long rest.
- One or more characters gain a level of exhaustion.
- The party is attacked.
- Some supplies are lost.
- Weather forces the party to stay indoors on the next day.
- The party ends up at a different location than was planned.

## Travel distance
The party travels are the slowest speed any of their party can travel.

{: .roll_table}
| Method        | Distance |
|:--------------|---|
| Walking       | 30km a day|
| Cart or Horse | 50km a day|
| Fast Horse    | 80km a day|

### Short Trips

If the target is within 1/3rd of the daily travel distance, then no roll needs to be made. The party knows the way and takes no risks that may cause them to get lost.

### Forced March
If all players decide to, the party can travel at double speed, forgoing their downtime activity completely but they will gain one level of exhaustion and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they suffer a second level of exhaustion.

If all characters are mounted, then only their mounts must make this saving throw.

## Supplies
Every day of travel consumes 1 unit of supplies per creature in the travelling party. This represents food, water and animal feed as well as other consumables.

The price of supplies varies, but generally these cost 1 gold piece per supply unit and can be purchased from any town or city. Smaller settlements may have limited stock, or charge a higher price.

Many downtime activities, spells and features allow the party to generate supplies while travelling.

If there are not enough supplies for a creature, then it gains a level of Exhaustion.

## Rest Location bonuses
Each location that the characters discover is marked on their map and can potentially be used again as a stopping point in a larger journey.

Each stopping point can have one or more special features that make it attractive as a destination. Some may even have special downtime activities that can be completed when visiting them.

Well **Location Bonus:** When camping here, the party consumes 1d4-1 less supplies than normal.

Defendable **Location Bonus:** When camping here, if combat breaks out, the attackers start with the Surprised condition.

# Resting Encounters
## Short Rest
At any time the players may declare they will take a short rest. If a player does not want to, or cannot benefit from the short rest they can compelte another long action in the same time period (such as searching the room or casting a ritual spell).

As long as a character can spend at least 15 minutes doing nothing more than eating, drinking, or resting, they may gain the benefits of a short rest.

A character must have at least 1 hit point to be able to benefit from a Short Rest.

During a short rest, a player may spend one or more of their characters Hit Dice. When they do, they may roll each one and add the character's Constitution score to the roll and recover that many hit points during the rest.

Many features allow the character to complete short actions during a short rest to gain certain effects.

Any resources that a character has that are recovered during a short rest are also recovered at the end of the rest.

Once a character has benefited from two short rests, they may not benefit from another one until they take a Long Rest.

## Long Rest
A character which can spend at least 8 hours resting or sleeping, with no more than 2 hours of light activity may gain the benefits of a long rest.

At the end of the rest period, a character regains half of their Hit Dice total. They also reset their current hit points to their hit point maximum.

In general, all character resources are replenished during a long rest, and all magic items will recharge based on their individual rules.

A character can only benefit from a single Long Rest every 24 hours of in game time.

A character must have at least 1 hit point to be able to benefit from a Long Rest.

Any Death saving throw failures that a player character has are removed during a Long Rest.

If a character is suffering from the Exhausted condition at the start of a Long Rest, they may remove one level of the condition.

# Skill Challenge Encounter

## Introduction
A skill challenge is a scene where the players narrate what happens and game master adjudicates. 

In a normal scene, the players explain their intent and the GM narrates the outcome based on a roll. During a skill challenge The GM only narrates an overview of the situation, to give the players something to feed off for inspiration. Then the players take it in turns narrating a shot of their character solving the problem. The GM only gives input during a shot to negotiate the difficulty with the player. After a roll, the active player finishes narrating either the positive or negative outcome.  If something goes really badly or the players are not sure what could happen, the GM can step in to help. Think of it like a film montage, but directed by the viewers.

## Example
> **GM:** You have been tracking your target all day and finally you find yourself in a crowded and lively bar, at a table on the upper floor overlooking the table of the target. The barmaid brings a round of unordered drinks and says “from your friend downstairs”. At that moment the target makes eye contact with you, heads for the door and punches a drunk, causing a bar fight to break out on the first floor. Let's resolve this using a Skill challenge. 4 successes needed before 3 failures.

> **Barbarian player:** I'd like to use my Athletics. Goresh vaults the balustrade, flipping a table to create a ramp as she lands so the others can make it faster to the door.

> **GM:** Make your roll, Medium difficulty (15) since the fight only just started. This sounds very in character of Goresh, so you can add 1 extra to your roll.

> **Barbarian player:** Rolls 17, success, even with a bad roll. I guess the table ends up exactly where I expected and Goresh makes it outside easily by pushing through the crowd of puny people.

> **GM:** Ok who wants to go next?

> **Bard player:** I’ll use Performance, perhaps I can soothe the fighting drunks with a song. Barry runs down the ramp towards the door, hammering out a calming song on his Lute. I’d also take one less max level spell slot in the next encounter to help out with magic. Perhaps if it really goes well he knee slides while he strums a particularly amazing riff.

> **GM:** Indeed, hammering out a soothing song will be Hard difficulty (20), especially against drunks. Spell slot gives you advantage however.

> **Bard player:** Rolls 18, failure. Damn! I don’t know what happens then.

> **GM:** You don’t stop running as you play and as you reach the door one of the drunks tries to tackle you to shut you up…

> **Ranger player:** \[Interrupting\] Gwen comes to the rescue, completing a triple somersault over the entire group of drunks, and pulls Barry out of danger, Acrobatics please!.

> **GM:** roll it… Hard difficulty (20)

> **Ranger player:** 25, success!

> **GM:** ok, that cancels the failure because you were so quick, but doesnt count as a success for the challenge. Nice save. You and Barry break into the alley in front of the tavern, and see Goresh looking around for the target.

> **Barbarian player:** I guess I'll try Survival to see if I can track him...

> **Rogue player:** Don’t bother. Lars whistles from a nearby rooftop and points out which way the target is heading. I was outside the whole time having a cigar with the cook and saw which way the target went. Stealth! *Rolls 27.

> **GM:** Indeed, regardless of difficulty that is a success. The party heads off in that direction. Does Goresh want to follow up with some Survival?

> **Barbarian player:** Nah, I’ll save it for now, Goresh only has 2 more skills to use.

> **Ranger player:** Gwen deftly climbs up to the roof and follows Lars, leaping between buildings and over the smaller alleys, trying to predict which way the target will turn and then try to cut him off. Insight?

> **GM:** or Perception, but it's midnight with a half moon and Gwen doesn't have darkvision, so it would be Easy (10) with disadvantage or Medium (15) with Insight.

> **Ranger player:** Insight please, Rolls 14. Close but a fail! Gwen takes a wrong turn. She swears loudly, which warns the target that they are closing.

> **GM:** Thanks for narrating your own failure! Very Gwen of you. Indeed the target has spotted the group! But the chase is still on. The target jumps down and enters a large door in a building. Looks like a stable or maybe a warehouse.

> **Barbarian player:** This guy knows we are on to him, time to do things the Goresh way. Goresh shoulder charges the door and as she smashes through the door, splinters flying, she roars “You can’t run AND you can’t hide! Come out and live!”. Intimidate, I rolled a 21.

> **GM:** Seems pretty frightening to me, even though this is the target’s home turf. Hard (20) so nice roll. The warehouse is dark, rows of shelves stand in long rows the whole length of the room. You hear something moving in the dark, the target is still here!

> **Rogue player:** Lars has been in this part of town before and remembers that the building only has two exits, he drops from the roof and enters through the second door. History? The target can’t escape now!

> **GM:** Sure, Lars has been here before, but History is a stretch! Hard (20).

> **Rogue player:** Rolls 19, damn! I guess there might be a third door...

> **GM:** That’s 2 out of 3 failures and 3 out of 4 successes. It’s getting tight. The party hears warning horns being blown and the Ranger’s enhanced hearing picks up shouts from the town watch. You all know that it isn't long until the fuzz arrives and once they do you won’t be allowed to question the target again. What do you have left that isn't used?

> **Bard player:** Persuasion… I guess I have that Scroll of Astral Projection I've been saving… but please, only as a last resort.

> **Barbarian player:** Survival. Everything else I have left has been used by someone else!

> **Rogue player:** Investigation and Sleight of Hand.

> **Ranger player:** Animal Handling… oh crap, that Acrobatics skill could have come in handy right now...

*So how does this play out? Think about what you would do with your character.*

## Why use a skill challenge?
Don't feel like leaving your party's success to a roll is good for your plot? Planned a non-interactive scene where you will narrate that success to your players? Instead of spending time coming up with interesting details for that scene, why not get your players to help out?

## Preparing for a Skill Challenge
To begin you only need an opening scene description which begins with the problem starting. You want to bring the players in on what is happening, so don't try to obfuscate the situation. Be very clear about what the players need to achieve, and how many successes and failures the test will involve.

Decided on a relevance level for each skill. These may become known to the players during the challenge, but to start with will most likely be secret. Some might be obvious, like the Stealth skill when sneaking into a castle to steal secret plans, or Survival when tracking a pack of wolves through the woods.

Tell your players that their characters cannot fail a skill challenge. The challenge measures HOW WELL they succeed, not IF they succeed.

Every action needs to be based on one of the characters skills, and only skills which that player is proficient in. Give your players warning so that they can already start thinking of fun ways to use a skill.

The game master will be less in control of the action than in a normal scene, this is the party’s turn to fully narrate the actions of their characters. If a player gets too creative, feel free to step in, but try not to shut them down. At most just bring them back to earth and let them continue.

Be aware of which players are most likely to want the limelight and which will try to stay out of it. Be prepared to involve all players at least once.

## The Structure
The party must collect enough successes, while gathering as few failures as possible. The players collect successes and failures by making rolls using Skill checks, and they make skill checks by narrating a shot of their character doing something to further the group goal.

{: .step_list}
1. Choose a skill
2. Narrate your shot
3. GM decides difficulty
4. Roll
5. Player narrated outcome.
6. GM narrated outcome.
7. Resolution

### Step 1: Choose a Skill
You may choose from any skill, as long as your character is proficient with it and no other player has used that skill in a previous shot. You may also use a Tool proficiency. Weapon and armor proficiencies are not usable at all. If you want to have your character communicate during your narration, they must have at least one Language which suits.

{: .example_green} 
In the example above, once the Ranger used their Acrobatics skill, the Rogue couldn’t use it anymore.

{: .example_red}
**Note:** Not all Skills are as relevant for a given skill challenge, but there is more about this below.


### Step 2: Narrate your shot
Tell everyone what your character does, and how it helps. Imagine the camera focusing on your character for this. Narrate what the character does right up until the critical moment, and what they intend to happen, before moving on to the next step. Make it dramatic! 

{: .itemlist_prefix}
The game master should look fondly upon the following:

{: .itemlist}
- Matching the narration to the skill chosen.
- Choosing an action/outcome which is in character.
- Choosing an action/outcome which matches one of your character's personality traits.
- Narrating the use of a one time item or feature.
- Creating leads which other players can use for inspiration.
- Using leads which the other players created.
- If there are mooks (throwaway npc’s) involve them in your narration.

{: .itemlist_prefix}
Things to avoid:

{: .itemlist}
- Narrating what another player’s character does.
- If there is a primary npc antagonist, narrating a reaction from them.
- - Narrating the end of the challenge. Just narrate something which brings the group closer to the goal. If you know this is the final success, then save your coop-de-gras for Step 5.

### Step 3: GM decides difficulty
While you could roll before you discover the difficulty, it is often worth it to wait, so you can haggle with the game master.

Relevant skills are one level easier, and non-relevant skills are one level harder.

The GM then decides on the difficulty. This determines the Difficulty Class for the check.

{: .roll_table}
| Task Difficulty       | DC  |
|:----------------------|-----|
| Very Easy             | 5   |
| Easy                  | 10  |
| Medium                | 15  |
| Hard                  | 20  |
| Very Hard             | 25  |
| Nearly Impossible     | 30  |


The GM will reward you with advantage, bonuses or even perhaps a change of difficulty based on your decided action, narration and if you make a sacrifice.

#### Sacrifice
A sacrifice involves committing to something which will make life difficult for the party. This can be simple like discarding an item, ability or token your character has. An example would be a spell slot or a valuable treasure. The sacrifice needs to be something of true loss so just expending spell slots while knowing the group will be taking a long rest soon is not a sacrifice.

{: .itemlist_prefix}
Some examples could be:

{: .itemlist}
- Using a non-rechargeable item that has one charge left.
- Lowering your spell slot maximum during the next rest.
- Gaining levels of exhaustion.
- Permanently losing an expensive item.
- Damage to equipment that may be expensive to repair.
- Losing trust or favour with a powerful patron or ally.
- Losing respect with the local populace.

{: .example_grey}
An example in the story above would have been when the Barbarian flipped the table, perhaps he could have bartered with the game master to have the difficulty lowered, at the expense of the tavern owner seeing it happen.

Another type of sacrifice can be made, in the form of raising the stakes. In these cases, you can ask the game master to add an extra consequence for failure in exchange for making a test easier. Be prepared for evil grins.
If the party is already doing very well, don’t push your luck by haggling too hard with the game master. Remember it is still their job to keep the game moving, so if they say no, just roll with it.

### Step 4: Roll
Simple as it comes. Roll a d20 and add your skill modifier. Equal or above and the party gains a success! Less, and you gain a failure. If one of your party members is making the roll this time, get ready to jump in, in case they fail (see below).

### Step 5: Player narrated outcome
This is your time to be the game master. Narrate how your character overcomes the situation, or how they fail. Especially, narrate how this costs the characters some valuable time or sets back their progress.

If you are not sure how to narrate the outcome, you can ask the game master to do it for you. Sometimes you have a really cool idea for a successful outcome in mind, but it just doesn't occur. Save that idea for a later date (or the Improvise action in combat). Never ask another player to narrate what your character does, that is only for you (and on occasions like this, the game master).
Remember, that you are not narrating a hard failure here, but something bad happening which hinders the character from adding progress to the overall goal.

{: .example_grey}
An example of this is when the Ranger makes the wrong call while following the target from the rooftops. They added a little something for other players to use for inspiration, and demonstrated how they didn’t add anything to the overall progress.

If it is another player's turn to roll, and they fail, you may interrupt in an attempt to have your character save them. Be quick, and don’t falter in your delivery! Repeat steps 2, 3 and 4 as fast as you can! Yell out your Skill and then start narrating how you get them out of this jam while rolling. The game master will decide your difficulty while you do this.

{: .example_grey}
An example of this from the story above is when the Ranger leaps out to save the Bard from being stuck in the bar fight.


### Step 6: GM narrated outcome
This is the game master's chance to add some new information, move the challenge to a new setting, or simply to finish up a player's narration.

{: .itemlist_prefix}
There could also be additional consequences for success or failure, such as:

{: .itemlist}
- The next skill test could be easier/harder.
- Loss of a resource, token, item, ect.
- Conditions being applied to characters.
- Revealing the relevance of a skill.
- Allowing a used skill to be reused.
- Disallowing a skill to be used.
- Making a skill less/more relevant.
- Revealing the required successes or failures.

{: .example_grey}
An example could be that had Stealth not been used previously, the Barbarian smashing through the warehouse door could have meant Stealth was no longer an option, or it is harder (less relevant).

{: .example_grey}
Another example could be that if the Bards song was very successful, perhaps the Persuasion skill could have become more relevant, prompting players to come up with shots that focus on using that skill.

### Step 7: Resolution
The game master does not need to reveal how many more successes or failures the party can take, they can instead try to show this through narration.

{: .example_grey}
In the example above, the game master could have only narrated the sound of the watch closing in, to let the players know they are one failure away from the end of the challenge. Instead in this case, they chose to mention it so the players could be sure.

If a player just gained the final success or failure, the game master should narrate the final part of the challenge. Remember that the challenge does not determine if the party wins or loses, but how good the outcome is. A complete failure only means they get the worst possible outcome for the wider plot.

### Start from the top
Go back to Step 1, but with a new player. How you determine the next player is up to your group. If you are getting into this, remember to think of the quietest person in your group and give them a chance to jump in. You are not the only hero that needs some screen time.

## Tips for Game Masters
Set a goal based on your game style
The number of successes that the players will need is tricky to choose. As a rough rule of thumb, setting the success goal to be (Number of player characters + 1), and the failure goal to be (Number of player characters  - 1) ensures that every player can have an opportunity to narrate before victory.
If your group has very short sessions, or your players need a little more time, don’t increase this number. Run it though and if they get into it, try to squeeze a second challenge in at the end with only 2 successes required.

For skill relevancies, make a list of all the skills your group has. Are there any that they rarely use? Are there any that the players take for granted? Based on that information, and the setting you intend to place them in, create your set of relevancies.

{: .example_grey}
An example: Your players all have Athletics, and groan whenever you ask for a skill challenge, easily succeeding with +10 to their rolls? Add in a hot day, and make those checks harder (less relevant) or even disallow them completely. Make sure they know this before you start.

### Set some constraints for yourself
Always set your goals and skill relevancies before beginning. It is all too easy to modify difficulty on the fly, and risk your players thinking you are making it too easy or hard. Since the outcome is not going to be a hard fail, perhaps you can let it be too difficult this time around, or let them have an easy win because this time they have to work for it either way.
This is also your opportunity to relax a little bit. Let them do the talking, dont reign them in unless they are being one step beyond crazy. You are just here to adjudicate the session.
### Set some constraints for your players
Be sure to limit committee talk. Your players should be individually shining a spotlight on themselves, not deciding the best course of action as a group, or spending a long time planning. In combat it is common that the Commander player type dictates actions for each character, but here you should work to discourage that.

Reward quick play, and especially reward any openings and leads that players create for others. Reward players for taking those openings as well. Those are the bricks from which the Tower of Improvised Acting is built!

Be on the lookout for players who are stealing the show, and those that are just spectating. It is easy for players to get over excited when you give them the reins.

### Set some constraints for the characters
Before beginning, make sure to give your players an opening which lets them guess at least some of the skill relevancies. The opportunities will build up as the challenge runs, but to start with it can be hard for players to build an interesting shot.
Be sure to set a few obvious no-go areas. An example here could be:

> **GM:** Its pitch black as you approach the nobles manor, only the smallest sliver of the moon shows deep on the horizon. To top that off, there are flocks of bats active throughout the night, making it harder to spot movement. All Perception tests will be one difficulty class higher for everyone, even those with darkvision. Those without darkvision will also have disadvantage.

Reward players using those rare skills. Most dungeon crawls rely heavily on Athletics (Strength), Stealth (Dexterity), Perception (Wisdom), but the others often get left behind.

What to do if they run out of skills:

{: .itemlist}
- A level 1 character can have a minimum of 2 skill proficiencies. Assuming the worst case and all the characters have the same proficiencies, they won’t have enough tests to get through a challenge. Here you can do a number of things:
- Allow the players to use Saving Throws as well.
- Ask each player to add a single proficiency to their character just for the skill challenge.
- Focus more on their consumable items.
- Allow them to use their weapons, spells or other attacks to outcome rolls.
- Allow them to use any skill, not just proficiencies.
- Allow using the same skill more than once, as long as the shots are differently narrated.

{: .itemlist_prefix}
If your group gets to the final check, but only has a few skills which are not very relevant remaining, you have a few options:

{: .itemlist}
- Tell them to suck it up and get creative (or crazy!)
- Allow them to risk a non-relevant check with easy difficulty to re-enable one more relevant skill.
- Give them an opening, allowing them to roll a plain ability score check.
- End the session there for a great cliffhanger, and give them until the next session to come up with a group shot.

## Other places to use skill challenges
There are a lot of places where skill challenges can replace the more tedious parts of your campaign. Here are just a few ideas.

If your group tends to be slower in combat, replace wandering monsters in a dungeon with a very short skill challenge. Since the characters won't be taking rests as often, allow them to use ammunition, hitpoint, hit dice and spell slots as sacrifices.

Overland travel can be completely replaced with skill challenges. Narrate one or more very simple obstacles that the group will pass on the way and have the players choose how they overcome them. This can also include random combat encounters. For example:

> **GM:** It is a three day trip to Westbridge along the river. The group will also have to go through Goblin Bone Pass and cross the Mad Kings Road at some point. Perhaps you should be extra careful and take 4 days? Medium skill challenge, 2 successes, go!

> **Rogue player:** Lars is always on point and scouts ahead at Dead mans pass, Stealth! \*rolls 19\* When the party catches up to him, he is dragging the last of the goblin corpses into a ditch by the roadside, it seems there WAS an ambush. Do they have any gold?

Other, longer events which would normally be filled with the GM having a conversation with himself, such as parties, political discussions, or theatre performances can suddenly involve the players.

Chase scenes and complex traps can be replaced with skill challenges.

If your group does not enjoy the very predictable nature of downtime activities, you could also replace them with a skill challenge. Just be sure to name the stakes beforehand, since many players use downtime to have concrete results.

# Exploration Encounters
The purpose of an exploration encounter is to set up the players for a combat encounter while offering them the chance to collect clues about the plot.

## Setup
The GM prepares several points of interest that may hold rewards or plot relevant clues.

Write an area description to be read out. Make sure each point of interest is mentioned at least in passing.

Each point of interest should have two different Ability scores that can be used.

The success and failure outcomes for each point of interest should be pre-written to save time, however this can also be improvised.

## The Structure

{: .step_list}
1. GM reads out description
2. Each player chooses what they will do
3. GM asks for Ability checks
4. Players negotiate Ability check
5. Checks are rolled
6. Resolution in success order.

## Action options
### Investigate something
Choose one of the points of interest that the GM mentioned. You can ask questions to help you decide.

### Watch for traps
Allows you to not only detect and or disarm traps that you already know about, but also protect the others performing actions from trapped objects.

### Stand guard
Selecting this action guarantees that if a fight breaks out you will not be Surprised at the start of combat.

## Negotiating Skill Checks
The GM will offer you one of two Ability scores to use. You can make arguments for using one of your skill proficiencies if you have any that you think match based on the description of the point of interest.

## Consequences of a failed roll
Generally there is nothing serious that should happen on a single failed roll.

If the majority of the party fail their skill checks perhaps combat can start with those that failed being Surprised.

## Tips for the GM
### Goal of the Encounter
There are several reasons why you might use this encounter type:
- Give the players a clue they need to advance the plot, without simply handing it to them.
- Give the characters a key item they need to unlock something they have already found.
- Provide more small locked objects for them to come back to.
- Give them a clue to make the next encounter easier.

### Description writing
Whenever possible, include some clue as to what is going to happen when a player inspects something.

### It does not need to be a check
Not every inspectable object needs to have an ability check associated. Outcomes can be guaranteed, just use the Ability check as a way to cover up that the outcome was guaranteed.

### Examples for each Ability Score
#### Strength
> **GM:** A human sized stone sarcophagus etched with runic symbols. The heavy capstone still has its wax seal unbroken.

- **Pass:** You manage to move the capstone enough to retrieve the item within.
- **Fail:** You manage to move the capstone but drop it. It breaks in half and creates a loud noise.
- **Traps check fail (or ignore):** As the capstone is removed, a jet of gas is blasted in your face. Constitution saving throw or fall asleep for 1 minute.
- **Traps check pass:** You discover a stone plug on the side of the sarcophagus and drain the toxic gas out before it is opened.

#### Dexterity
> **GM:** An iron grill set in the roof can clearly be opened. The darkness behind gives no hint of what could be found behind.

- **Pass:** You manage to climb in and find a hidden tunnel. Not only is it a perfect hiding spot, you find a small cache of goodies.
- **Fail:** While climbing up you bend the grill. It no longer can be closed. But you do find the goodies.
- **Traps check fail (or ignore):** A wire attached to the grill sounds an alarm.
- **Trap checks pass:** Just as your ally is climbing up, you spot the wire and disarm it.

#### Constitution
> **GM:** A water well, full to the brim. Something glints at the bottom.

- **Success:** Even though something grabs you lightly while swimming down, you hold your breath long enough to reach the bottom and retrieve the shiny thing.
- **Fail:** You do manage to retrieve the shiny thing, but you lose a hit die.

#### Intelligence
#### Wisdom
#### Charisma
