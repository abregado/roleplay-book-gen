Upon reaching zero hit points a creature gains the Bleeding out condition. If the bleeding out condition is not resolved then the character is considered Dead.

Resurrection is almost always possible in this setting. The difficulty of Resurrection is based on a number of things, but most importantly the time since the character became deceased.

Resurrection always expends resources, in most cases it is a gemstone. The more difficult the resurrection process is, the more perfect and therefore expensive, the gemstone needs to be.
