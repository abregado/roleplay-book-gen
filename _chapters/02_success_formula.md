# How is success decided?
There is only one type of dice roll used to determine success, with two variations. These can have some modifiers which are also listed below.

# Skill Check
Every skill check has a target number that must be equalled or beaten for the check to succeed called the Difficulty Class (or just DC). The DC of a check can be kept secret by the Game Master.

To roll a skill check, a player rolls a D20. Any number equal or greater than the DC of the check means that the check was successful. Any lower number means that the skill check was a failure. A success generally means that something positive will happen, or that a player's intended outcome comes to pass. A failure either means that the intended outcome does not happen, or that it happens but with a cost.

*examples here*

The Game master may call for a Skill Check associated with one of the six Abilities (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Willpower, Charisma). In this case, a player must add or subtract their Ability value from the number rolled.

The player who will be rolling the skill check can ask if any of their Proficiencies are relevant, and add one of the relevant bonuses to the number rolled.

## Saving Throw
A saving throw is made the same way as a Skill Check, however on a success, the character avoids something bad happening to them. Saving throws are never Risky as failure already means something bad will happen.

## Attack Roll
An attack roll is made the same way as a Skill Check, however only proficiencies which match with the weapon the character are using are considered. Instead of a DC, the check must meet or exceed the Armor Class of the target.

If successful, then the weapon's effect is read out and applied to the target. This generally means hit points are removed from the target (a fixed or random amount) but can include other effects, including further skill checks or saving throws.

## Risky Skill Checks
When a skill check is risky it means there is a small chance of catastrophic failure. Roll the skill check as normal but if the dice result is a 1, then it is considered a Catastrophic failure. The Game Master has an opportunity to decide the outcome of the failure, or pass the narration rights to another player.
## Skill Checks with Advantage or Disadvantage
The circumstances under which a character makes a skill check affect their chances. When the circumstances are ideal then a Skill check must be taken “with advantage”. When the circumstances are not ideal or something is hindering their progress, a Skill check must be taken “with disadvantage”.

To make a skill check with advantage, the player rolls 2D20 and **discards the lowest** rolled dice. The remaining dice are used to calculate the result as per the regular skill check rules.

To make a skill check with disadvantage, the player rolls 2D20 and **discards the highest** rolled dice. The remaining dice is used to calculate the result as per the regular skill check rules.

**Examples of advantageous situations:** character can take their time, has the perfect tool for the job, or someone else can assist them without interruption.

{: .example_red}
**Examples of disadvantageous situations:** the character is under time pressure, has broken tools or someone is interfering with their attempts.

A skill check cannot be made with both advantage and disadvantage. In this case they would cancel out and the skill check would be made as normal. It is also not possible to stack levels of advantage, so any number of effects which cause advantage will cancel out any number of effects which cause disadvantage.
