# Spellcasting Ability
Each type of magic is based on one of these Ability scores: Wisdom, Intelligence, Charisma

# Types of Spell Effect
Spells either cause one of three effects:

A target must pass a saving throw or suffer the effect of the spell.

You must make a spell attack roll for the target to suffer the effect.

The effect is automatic and generally its effect is explained in the spell test.

# Spell Components
Each spell requires either a Verbal, Somatic or Material component.

- Verbal components represent an audio requirement to form the spell. A song, sound or spoken phrase is common.
- Somatic components represent a movement of the casters hand. Full arm flourishes as well as precise finger movements are common.
- Material components could be either items that need to be consumed for the spell to function or a particular item that must be held in the casters hand for the spell to function.

Spells with verbal components cannot be cast if you are suffering the Silenced condition.

Spells with Somatic components cannot be cast if you are suffering the Bound condition and the caster must have a free hand.

Spells with a Material component cannot be cast if you are not in possession of the required item or have a focus equipped.

# Spell Slots
A spellcaster can only cast a limited number of spells before needing to rest. Each spellcasting class has a table that shows how many spell slots of each level a character can use at each character level. When a character casts a spell, they expend a slot of that spell's level or higher.

Some characters or monsters have special abilities that allow them to cast spells without using spell slots.

All spell slots are recharged during a Long Rest.

# Casting at a higher level
Some spells allow the caster to expend a higher level spell slot, or some other resource, to increase the spells level and increase the power of its effect.

# Spell keywords
Some keywords appear in spell text.
## Seen target
The target must be detected by the caster. Invisible targets cannot for example be targeted unless the caster has Truesight or some other method of detecting exactly where the target is.
## Touch target
A target must be able to be touched by the free hand (or material component) used to cast this spell. In the case of incorporeal targets or casters, their physical manifestations must at least overlap in some way.
## Self Target
The target is the caster. It cannot be another target in the same space. In the case of many spells, this refers to the originating point of the spell, as is the case with Area of Effect spells.

## Area of Effect spells
These spells either effect all creatures within their described area of effect, or they allow the caster to select which targets within the area will be effected.

## Spell saving throw
The Difficulty Class of saving throws made to resist your spell effects is 8 + proficiency + Spellcasting Ability score.
## Spell attack roll
Spell attack rolls are made with a bonus of your spellcasting ability score + proficiency.

It is important to note in the spell text if the attack roll is a ranged spell attack roll or a melee spell attack roll.
## Concentration
Spells that require concentration must be actively maintained in order to keep their magic active, and if concentration is lost, the spell ends. The spell's "Duration" entry will indicate if it requires concentration and how long it can be maintained. You can end concentration at any time as a Free Action. Normal activities such as moving or attacking do not interfere with concentration. However, casting another spell that requires concentration, being incapacitated, or being killed all break concentration immediately. The GM may also decide that certain environmental factors or taking damage may require a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration. If damage is taken, the DC is either 10 or half the damage taken, whichever is higher. The DC for Environmental, such as strong wind or loud noises is set by the GM when the test is to be taken.
