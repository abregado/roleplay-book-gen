# Attunement
Some magical items require attunement to a specific operator in addition to being equipped before their capabilities become usable.

Any character can spend 1 uninterrupted hour with a magic item to attune to it. Doing so reveals its workings and effects to the player. Any effects which are triggered by attunement are also applied.

An item cannot be attuned to multiple characters at the same time. After an attunement is complete, the item loses all other attunements it had.

An item becomes unattuned if it spends at least 1 hour further than 100 metres from its attuned character.

Each character can only be attuned to three magic items at a time without suffering from harmful effects.

When attuning to an item, a character may drop attunement with another within the same time period.

# Charges and Recharging
Some magical items can only be used several times before needing to recharge. Each item that has charges will also include a description of how it is recharged.

The most common situation is that an item will recharge some or all of its charges when its owner takes a long rest.

# Magic Item Collection

**Tacticians Wit. Rare clasp (Tiny/Divination). 900gp.**

**Passive:** +1 to Initiative rolls

Once per day, after Initiative is rolled, swap your Initiative score with that of another willing creature.

**Sol. Great Maul (Evocation). 10,000gp.**

Heavy, Two-handed. Strike: 2d10 bludgeoning damage. The highest damage dice rolled may cause Radiant damage instead of Bludgeoning, at your discretion.

1 Charge

**Action:** Spend 1 Charge. Holding the weapon aloft, it begins to glow as bright as the sun. For the next hour, the weapon emits bright light out to 60ft and dim light out to 120ft. The bright light counts as Sunlight for the purposes of magical effects. Any magical darkness up to level 3 which is covered by this bright light is dispelled immediately.

**Action:** Spend 1 Charge. Cast the Sanctuary spell on yourself.

**Cloudreign, Thoughtcapture Vial. Rare vial (Tiny/Abjuration). 2000gp**

This dark blue vial allows you to read another's surface thoughts and capture them as thought strands, storing the strands within the vial.

**Action:** Target a creature you can see within 10 feet of you to learn its surface thoughts and pull the thoughts learned out of the creature's head as a tangible glowing string of energy known as a thought strand. The strands can be stored indefinitely in the vial or until the vial reaches capacity, in which case the oldest strands dissipate. A creature affected by the vial knows that its thoughts are being probed.

Thought strands created using the Encode Though cantrip can be stored in the item. Such strands have their duration extended indefinitely.

The vial has 3 charges and can store up to 3 thought strands. It regains all its charges daily at dusk.

If attuned to a character with the Psi Warrior subclass, the stored thoughts can be spent as additional Psi dice (d4). If the thought is a particularly powerful one, the dice may be higher, at the DMs discretion. Psi Warriors attuned in this way also increase their Intelligence ability score modifier by +1 for the purposes of their psionic powers, and also learn the Encode Thoughts cantrip.
