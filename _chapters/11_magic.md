Magic
Each type of magic is based on one of these Ability scores: Wisdom, Intelligence, Charisma

The Difficulty Class of saving throws made to resist your spell effects is 8 + proficiency + Spellcasting Ability score.

Spell attack rolls are made with a bonus of your spellcasting ability score + proficiency

Every spell costs a spell slot of the same level as the spell cast.

Each spell requires either a Verbal, Somatic or Material component.

Spells with verbal components cannot be cast if you are suffering the Silenced condition.
Spells with Somatic components cannot be cast if you are suffering the Bound condition and the caster must have a free hand.
Spells with a Material component cannot be cast if you are not in possession of the required item or have a focus equipped.

All spell slots are recharged during a Long Rest.
