Resting is the primary way of regaining spent Resources and hitpoints. There are two types of rest.

Long rest
Takes 8 hours. Only one Long rest can be taken per 24 hours. Restores all resources from character features. Restores all hitpoints. Restored half of a character's Stamina dice. Removes one level of exhaustion if taken in a comfortable and safe location.

Short rest
Takes 1 hour. Once a short rest is taken, one cannot be taken again until the character has had a long rest. During a short rest, some resources may be restored (see the particular resource ruling). Characters may spend some or all of their Stamina dice to recover hit points.
