## Equipping items
Each character has a number of hands. Each item takes a number of hands to be considered Equipped. Equipped items allow a character to utilise any of their actions or abilities. An item's passive abilities are considered to be active if the item is Equipped.

During a combat encounter, a single item can be equipped to or from a free hand per combat round as a Free action. An item equipped in a hand can be dropped to the floor as a Free Action, as many times as the player likes.

Outside a combat encounter, a player may declare that a character is changing their equipped items at any time, given the narrative allowance to do so. A player may not interrupt a situation to change their equipped items unless the game master allows it. 

Other equipment can be equipped at the discretion of the Game master. Generally this is done using common sense. A character can, for example, not wear two pairs of shoes or two helmets at a time.

The time it takes to equip other equipment will vary depending on the item in question. It only takes a few seconds to equip a hat or helmet, but correctly equipping a suit of chainmail armor may take several minutes.

## Carrying Capacity
Characters may carry any number of items in their inventories, within reasonable limits. This limit is adjudicated by the Game Master. If the Game Master feels a character is carrying too many items, they can apply the following condition.

**Overburdened (Condition):** The character suffers disadvantage on all saving throws, skill checks and attack rolls until they discard some of their items. Their attacks and skill checks become risky, with critical failure resulting in items being dropped, or possibly destroyed. Attacks made against them have the chance to damage items. If the character completes a strenuous task while overburdened, they gain a level of exhaustion.
