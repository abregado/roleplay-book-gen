# Class Feature Changes
## Bard, Maestro subclass
### Frenetic Crescendo

At 6th level, you can harness the beat of battle, whipping it into a frenzy of drums, chants, and glory. You can use your **bonus action** to expend any number of uses of your Bardic Inspiration feature. For each expended use, you can immediately grant a Bardic Inspiration die to a creature other than yourself within 60 feet that you can see. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

## Fighter, Psi Warrior subclass
### Telekinetic Adept

Add this extra action to the others gained in this feature at level 7.

**Telekinetic Shove**

**Bonus Action:** Expend a Psionic Energy dice and choose a friendly creature you can see. That creature can move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
