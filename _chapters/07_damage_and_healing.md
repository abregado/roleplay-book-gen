# Stamina Dice
Pool of dice used while resting to restore hit points. These are granted based on which classes the character selects.

# Hit points
Characters have a number of Hit Points. Weapons deal either a random or fixed amount of damage on a hit.

# Temporary Hit Points
Characters may also have a number of temporary hit points. These are always lost before regular hitpoints. A character's temporary hit points cannot be healed, and a character can only ever have one pool of temporary hit points. If an effect grants more temporary hit points, then all old temporary hit points are removed before the new ones are added.

# Damage types and resistance
There are a number of damage types that a weapon or spell can do. Each weapon or spell may cause multiple damage types.

- Mundane damage types: **Non-lethal**, **Bludgeoning, Slashing, Piercing** and **Poison**.
- Elemental damage: **Cold**, **Fire**, **Acid**, **Thunder**, **Lightning**.
- Magical damage types: **Magical Bludgeoning, Slashing, Piercing**, **Radiant** and **Necrotic**.
- Special damage types: **Psychic** and **Force**.

Characters may be vulnerable, resistant or immune to certain damage types. A vulnerable character takes double damage from appropriate sources. A resistant character takes half damage from sources it is resistant to. When a character is immune to a damage type, it never takes damage from sources of that type.

# Concentration and damage
When a character is concentrating on a task or spell and it suffers damage it must make a Concentration check. This is a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 10 or the amount of damage taken, whichever is higher. A failure means that concentration has been broken.

# Death and resurrection
Upon reaching zero hit points a creature gains the Bleeding out and Unconscious conditions. These conditions are removed if the creature gains at least one hit point. If the Bleeding Out condition is not resolved then the character is considered Dead.

Resurrection is almost always possible in this setting. The difficulty of Resurrection is based on a number of things, but most importantly the time since the character became deceased. When a character dies, be sure to record the time of death on their sheet. Seconds, minutes, hours and days are important here.

Resurrection always expends resources, in most cases it is a gemstone. The more difficult the resurrection process is, the more perfect and therefore expensive, the gemstone needs to be. 

# Unimportant characters, monsters and death
When a creature falls to zero hit points, it is considered dead immediately unless it is either a player character or a character of import such as a villain or important story character.

# Instant Character Death and Overkill
Damage beyond a creature's current hit point total have no effect. If a creature is caused damage equal to its maximum health in a single hit, it dies instantly.

# Non-lethal damage
When a creature makes a strike, it may declare the strike to be non-lethal. 

Reducing a monster's hit points to zero using such an attack will apply only the Unconscious condition. The monster can make a Constitution saving throw every hour to remove this condition.
