Stamina Dice
Pool of dice used while resting to restore hit points. These are granted based on which classes the character selects.
Hit points
Characters have a number of Hit Points. Weapons deal either a random or fixed amount of damage on a hit.

Whenever a character levels up it rolls its Stamina dice and adds its constitution modifier * its class levels. If the result is higher than the character's current hit point maximum then the result becomes its new hit point maximum.

Temporary Hit Points
Characters may also have a number of temporary hit points. These are always lost before regular hitpoints. A character's temporary hit points cannot be healed, and a character can only ever have one pool of temporary hit points. If an effect grants more temporary hit points, then all old temporary hit points are removed before the new ones are added.

Damage types and resistance
There are a number of damage types that a weapon or spell can do. Each weapon or spell may cause multiple damage types.

Mundane damage types: Non-lethal, Bludgeoning, Slashing, Piercing and Poison.
Elemental damage: Cold, Fire, Acid, Thunder, Lightning
Magical damage types: Magical Bludgeoning, Slashing, Piercing, Radiant and Necrotic
Special damage types: Psychic and Force

Characters may be vulnerable, resistant or immune to certain damage types. A vulnerable character takes double damage from appropriate sources. A resistant character takes half damage from sources it is resistant to. When a character is immune to a damage type, it never takes damage from sources of that type.

Concentration and damage
When a character is concentrating on a task or spell and it suffers damage it must make a Concentration check. This is a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 10 or the amount of damage taken, whichever is higher. A failure means that concentration has been broken.
