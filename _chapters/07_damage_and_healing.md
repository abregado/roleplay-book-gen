# Stamina Dice
Pool of dice used while resting to restore hit points. These are granted based on which classes the character selects.

# Hit points
Characters have a number of Hit Points. Weapons deal either a random or fixed amount of damage on a hit.

Whenever a character levels up it rolls its Stamina dice and adds its constitution modifier * its class levels. If the result is higher than the character's current hit point maximum then the result becomes its new hit point maximum.

# Temporary Hit Points
Characters may also have a number of temporary hit points. These are always lost before regular hitpoints. A character's temporary hit points cannot be healed, and a character can only ever have one pool of temporary hit points. If an effect grants more temporary hit points, then all old temporary hit points are removed before the new ones are added.

# Damage types and resistance
There are a number of damage types that a weapon or spell can do. Each weapon or spell may cause multiple damage types.

- Mundane damage types: **Non-lethal**, **Bludgeoning, Slashing, Piercing** and **Poison**.
- Elemental damage: **Cold**, **Fire**, **Acid**, **Thunder**, **Lightning**.
- Magical damage types: **Magical Bludgeoning, Slashing, Piercing**, **Radiant** and **Necrotic**.
- Special damage types: **Psychic** and **Force**.

Characters may be vulnerable, resistant or immune to certain damage types. A vulnerable character takes double damage from appropriate sources. A resistant character takes half damage from sources it is resistant to. When a character is immune to a damage type, it never takes damage from sources of that type.

# Concentration and damage
When a character is concentrating on a task or spell and it suffers damage it must make a Concentration check. This is a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 10 or the amount of damage taken, whichever is higher. A failure means that concentration has been broken.

# Death and resurrection
Upon reaching zero hit points a creature gains the Bleeding out condition. If the bleeding out condition is not resolved then the character is considered Dead.

Resurrection is almost always possible in this setting. The difficulty of Resurrection is based on a number of things, but most importantly the time since the character became deceased.

Resurrection always expends resources, in most cases it is a gemstone. The more difficult the resurrection process is, the more perfect and therefore expensive, the gemstone needs to be.

# Unimportant characters, monsters and death
When a creature falls to zero hit points, it is considered dead immediately unless it is either a player character or a character of import such as a villain or important story character.

# Falling Unconscious
If a creature has no hit points remaining it gains the Unconscious condition. This condition is removed as soon as the creature has more than zero hit points.

# Bleeding out
When a player character starts its turn with 0 hit points, it must make a saving throw against Death (also called a Death saving throw) using a d20 to determine if it can cling to life. This saving throw is not tied to any ability score and so can only be aided by spells and features that effect saving throws. The DC for this saving throw is 10.

Successes and failures don't have to be consecutive and are reset when the character regains hit points or becomes stable. Successes are recorded separately for each character making these saving throws.

As soon as a character accrues three successes, the Unconscious condition is removed and the character is healed to 1 hit point.

As soon as a character accrues three failures, the character is considered dead.

A roll of 1 counts as two failures and a roll of 20 counts and three successes.

If an unconscious character took damage since its last turn, it gains an additional failure, and must still roll a saving throw.

If an unconscious character is healed, even for 1 hit point, the unconscious condition is removed. Temporary hit points do not count here, but may be applied as normal to block damage that would otherwise reduce the target's maximum hit point count.

# Instant Character Death
Damage beyond a creature's current hit point total reduces the creature's maximum hit points. If a creature ever has a maximum hit point value of 0 then it dies immediately regardless of if it is a player character or important character.

# Non-lethal damage
When a creature makes a strike, it may declare the strike to be non-lethal. Any damage caused by the strike will not reduce the target's maximum hit points.

Reducing a monster's hit points to zero using such an attack will apply the Unconscious condition. The monster can make a Constitution saving throw every hour to remove this condition.
