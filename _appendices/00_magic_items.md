**Sol. Great Maul (Evocation). 10,000gp.**

Heavy, Two-handed. Strike: 2d10 bludgeoning damage. The highest damage dice rolled may cause Radiant damage instead of Bludgeoning, at your discretion.

1 Charge

**Action:** Spend 1 Charge. Holding the weapon aloft, it begins to glow as bright as the sun. For the next hour, the weapon emits bright light out to 60ft and dim light out to 120ft. The bright light counts as Sunlight for the purposes of magical effects. Any magical darkness up to level 3 which is covered by this bright light is dispelled immediately.

**Action:** Spend 1 Charge. Cast the Sanctuary spell on yourself.

**Cloudreign, Thoughtcapture Vial. Rare vial (Tiny/Abjuration). 2000gp**

This dark blue vial allows you to read another's surface thoughts and capture them as thought strands, storing the strands within the vial.

**Action:** Target a creature you can see within 10 feet of you to learn its surface thoughts and pull the thoughts learned out of the creature's head as a tangible glowing string of energy known as a thought strand. The strands can be stored indefinitely in the vial or until the vial reaches capacity, in which case the oldest strands dissipate. A creature affected by the vial knows that its thoughts are being probed.

Thought strands created using the Encode Though cantrip can be stored in the item. Such strands have their duration extended indefinitely.

The vial has 3 charges and can store up to 3 thought strands. It regains all its charges daily at dusk.

If attuned to a character with the Psi Warrior subclass, the stored thoughts can be spent as additional Psi dice (d4). If the thought is a particularly powerful one, the dice may be higher, at the DMs discretion. Psi Warriors attuned in this way also increase their Intelligence ability score modifier by +1 for the purposes of their psionic powers, and also learn the Encode Thoughts cantrip.
