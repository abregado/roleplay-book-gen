Roll initiative only once for all creatures of the same type.

Monster abilities should only require an attack roll OR a saving throw, never both.

Special features for regular monsters should only trigger during their own turn.

If a creature has a reaction, it should have a very specific and obvious trigger so that the players can avoid it in the future.

Don't ask for a skill check when giving out required information. Only when the information is optional.

Give out Flashbacks instead of letting the players plan.

Give saleable items instead of just Gold. This creates downtime opportunities with built-in rewards. These items can potentially become quest hooks as well.
