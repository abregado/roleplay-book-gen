# Reactions
## Close In
**When a player character moves toward this creature:** Two creatures within 30ft may move up to their walking speed to intercept the PC. If either of them move within 5ft of the PC, the PC may not move any further this turn. 

## Surprising Toughness
**When the creature is about to suffer damage while it has the Surprised condition:** The creature gains 50 temporary hit points until the end of its next turn. While it has these hitpoints, it is vulnerable to one elemental damage type.

## Fully Operational
**When the creature is about to suffer damage while it has the Surprised condition:** All of its recharge abilities recharge automatically. The creature takes a Legendary action immediately.

## Keep kicking
**When a creature within 5ft removes the Prone condition by spending half of its movement:** Make a melee weapon attack against the target. If it causes any damage, the target gains the Prone condition, and may not spend any movement this turn.

# Legendary Actions
## Draconic Wall
Recharge (5+): If the dragon is flying, it breathes a line of draconic energy across the battlefield which hardens into a wall 5ft wide, 20ft high and 60ft long. The wall is opaque and lasts for 1 minute. When the wall appears, each creature within its area must pass a Dexterity saving throw or suffer 5d8 damage points of the same elemental type as the dragons breath attack. Passing this save results in half damage. Either way, targets are moved out of the walls area, in a direction of their own choice.

Entering the walls area on purpose causes 5d8 damage with no save allowed.

## Bodyguard
Two other creatures within 30ft can move 15ft. This creature can move 10ft without provoking attacks of opportunity.
